## Features & Functionality

### 1. **Navbar**
The website includes a responsive navigation bar with the following components:
- **Logo**
- **Menu Options**:
  - Home
  - Categories
  - About
  - Contact

### 2. **Hero Section**
- A carousel showcasing product images.
- Smooth transitions for the carousel slides to improve the user experience.

### 3. **Product Listing Section**
This section displays a list of products, each represented by a product card.
- **Layout**:
  - Desktop View: Displays 4 cards in a row.
  - Mobile View: Displays 2 cards in a row.
  
- **Product Card Components**:
  - Product Image
  - Product Title
  - Price
  - Ratings 

- **Pagination**: 
  - The initial page shows 12 products.
  - The **"Show More"** button allows users to dynamically load 12 more products on each click until no more products remain.

### 4. **Product Details Page**
- **Left Section**: Displays a product image carousel (showing multiple images for each product).
- **Right Section**: Displays product details, including:
  - Product Title
  - Price
  - Description
  - Ratings
  - **"Add to Cart"** button or any other relevant information.

- The navbar is consistent across the homepage and product details page.

### 5. **Functionality Requirements**
- **Show More Button**: 
  - Dynamically loads 12 more products each time itâ€™s clicked until all products are displayed.

- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: 
  - Both the product listing page and individual product details pages are built using SSR to improve SEO and performance.

- **Scroll Position Persistence**:
  - When navigating back from the product details page to the listing page, the scroll position on the listing page is preserved.

### 6. **API Integration**
- The project integrates with the **[DummyJSON Products API](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products)** to fetch product data.
- Error handling and loading states are managed during API calls to ensure a smooth user experience.

### 7. **Mobile Optimization**
- The product listing is fully optimized for mobile devices. On mobile, the page will display 2 cards per row, ensuring an optimal viewing experience.
